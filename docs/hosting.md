# Hosting Lakelands in a platform

This page is for a platform that embeds Lakelands as its store: it
supplies identities, runs agents and workers, talks to the outside world,
and wants the lakes underneath to be Lakelands. It describes the same
seams that `lakelands-api` declares and `docs/seams.md` specifies, seen
from the host's side. If this page and the contract ever disagree, the
contract is right and this page is wrong.

## What a host implements

Lakelands has seven seams. A host implements the ones it needs; every
seam has a default, so a host that implements none still has a working
store.

- **Engine** (`LakeEngine`, `ProjectionStore`, `ProjectionView`, with
  `VectorIndex` beside it as the engine's index trait). Usually nothing
  to implement: SQLite and in-memory engines ship with `0.1.0`, and
  PostgreSQL follows right after. A new engine is accepted when it
  passes the conformance suite.
- **`PrincipalResolver`.** Maps the host's identities, roles and
  policies onto one `Principal { kind, id, lake, grants }` per call.
  Grants are per field and per principal, and the store enforces them
  on every read and write, so the host never gates reads or writes
  itself. See `docs/decisions/006-grants-not-roles.md`.
- **`FunctionBacking`.** A backing is an open token; `0.1.0` ships
  `expr`, the built-in evaluator, and `http` and `exec` follow. A host
  may add its own backing kind. Its output is recorded as a
  provenance-stamped record and read back on replay, never recomputed.
  See `docs/decisions/002-determinism-is-the-boundary.md`.
- **`EmbedBackend`.** A host may pass vectors in with its writes or
  plug in an embedding client. `0.1.0` searches lexically and over
  caller-supplied vectors; an OpenAI-compatible client follows right
  after.
- **`VerbExecutor`.** A verb declared `low` risk that writes authored
  fields runs in the store; any other verb lands as `WriteProposed`.
  The host decides what happens next, and the store records `accept`
  and `reject` as events. Without a bound executor, a verb that
  reaches outside the lake is refused, not faked. See
  `docs/decisions/013-verbs-run-by-declared-risk.md`.
- **`ChangeFeed`.** The host reads the log, filtered by kind, from a
  cursor, and acknowledges on its own side. The host keeps its cursor;
  the store keeps no consumer state. A relay onto a message bus is the
  host's code, never Lakelands'; the dedup key of a change is
  `{lake}:{position}`. See `docs/decisions/004-the-change-feed-is-the-log.md`.
- **`SystemVocabulary`.** The host registers its own `sys.*` types and
  says which lakes may hold them. Lakelands reserves only the four types
  its own fold reads. See `docs/decisions/003-reservation-by-namespace.md`.

**Configuration is not a seam.** Engine configuration, tuning, limits
and an optional key handle reach a lake through `Location`, and a
server through its server configuration; Lakelands never reads the
environment. A host that keeps settings in its environment reads them
and passes them in. See `docs/decisions/005-no-environment-reads.md`.

## How a host switches onto Lakelands

A host that already has a store of its own moves in four steps.

1. **Freeze the old store.** From this point it takes bug fixes only,
   and every fix is logged so it can be ported to Lakelands before the
   switch.
2. **Implement the seams against a tagged `lakelands-api`** while the
   old store still serves. Each seam implementation gets a test that
   fails before it and passes after.
3. **Cut over in one step.** Consumers re-point to Lakelands, pinned by
   tag, never by bare revision. Any contract the host exposes to its own
   plugins is adapted onto `lakelands-api`. The old store and the
   duplicate doors built around it are deleted, not wrapped in shims.
   The port log is empty before this step starts.
4. **Walk the host's own end-to-end scenario** on the new tag before
   calling the switch done. Behaviour the conformance suite did not
   cover shows up here, and it is fixed in Lakelands, not worked around
   in the host.

## Rules the host inherits

- **One tool surface.** The catalog is the only tool surface. A host
  adds no second query door beside it and no hand-written tool names.
- **Invariants live in the store.** Field rights, per-field provenance
  and the `sys.` guard are enforced on every write by the store, so a
  host-side check is never a substitute and never needed. See
  `docs/decisions/010-provenance-per-field.md` and
  `docs/decisions/012-writes-touch-only-their-fields.md`.
- **One writer per lake.** A lake has one writing process at a time,
  held by a lease; one process may write many lakes. See
  `docs/decisions/008-one-writer-per-lake.md`.
- **No query across lakes.** A lake is one world with one truth; a host
  that needs data from two lakes reads each of them.
- **Every answer carries its position.** A host that records what an
  agent saw records the position, and reads `as_of` it later. See
  `docs/decisions/009-every-response-carries-its-position.md`.
