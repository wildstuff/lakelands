# 024 — Probing a field needs the right to read it

## What is decided

A read that filters on a field, orders by it, aggregates over it or
searches it is refused when the principal may not read that field —
also when the field would have been masked in the answer. The refusal
names the field.

`describe` holds to the same line: a masked field is described by its
shape only — its name, type, access, whether it is required and
sensitive, its authority and what an input change does to it — never by
what it is computed from or what it means, and a function, trigger,
object set or view that names a field the principal may not read is not
described to it. This tightened in 0.4.0 (lakelands#206).

## Why

Masking the answer does not protect a value the question already
revealed. A filter `salary > 100000` answers, record by record, whether
the hidden salary is above the line; a sum over a group of one is that
record's salary; an ordering ranks the hidden values. Each of these
turns a masked field into an oracle. Refusing the question is the only
answer that leaks nothing.

## What it is not

- It does not refuse reads of records that merely have such a field. A
  record is still returned with the field masked or absent.
- It is not a rule for writers. A write is governed by the principal's
  write grants (006, 012).
